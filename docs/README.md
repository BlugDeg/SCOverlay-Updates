## What is SCOverlay?

**SCOverlay is not just another tool‚Äîit's an ecosystem.** It is a lightweight, powerful, and stable in-game overlay for Star Citizen, designed from the ground up to be extended. Whether you need a precise timer for hangar doors, a real-time intelligence monitor for player encounters, or a quick way to display your trade route maps, SCOverlay provides the platform to make it happen.

Our philosophy is simple: **Performance First, Modularity Always.** We provide a rock-solid core so that you and the developer community can build the features you need without ever compromising your framerate.

## Key Features

-   üöÄ **Extensible Addon Architecture:** The heart of SCOverlay. A clean and stable API allows developers to easily create and integrate new features.
-   ‚ö° **Performance-Driven Core:** A built-in "Performance Watchdog" continuously monitors system load to prevent frame drops, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.
-   üé® **Fully Customizable UI:** Move, resize, and style the overlay to perfectly match your cockpit setup.
-   ‚å®Ô∏è **Robust Hotkey System:** Built with low-level keyboard hooks to guarantee reliability, even in the most intense dogfights.
-   üîÑ **Integrated Auto-Updater:** The core application and all addons receive updates seamlessly, keeping your toolkit on the cutting edge.
